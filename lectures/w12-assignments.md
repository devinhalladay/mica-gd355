# Week 12 assignments

## Project: Data-driven Form-making
1. Find the dataset you want to work with. Spend enough time to explore different kinds of data before you settle with one.
1. Create first prototypes. The visuals may be simple but this prototype should demonstrate a successful loading and displaying of data into your p5js sketch.
1. Bring in other materials that will help the class to understand your idea better. Your own sketches, inspirations, references, and other resources.
