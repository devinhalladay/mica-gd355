## Coding exercise

- In a p5.js sketch, **draw your self-portrait with code.** 
- All graphics must be created with code. Bonus: use variables and mouse interactions! 
- Upload the entire sketch folder ( + a screenshot image of the sketch) onto Google Drive Week 2 folder.
- Use this exercise as an opportunity to explore various drawing functions. Push yourself. Do more.
- When you don't know how to create something, do some research online. That's how everyone learns to code - by searching on Google.
