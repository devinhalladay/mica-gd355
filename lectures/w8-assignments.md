# Week 8 assignments

## Prepare the data
We have to be extremely careful about collecting other people’s data and using them. We need proper consents and other systematic measures to store/retrieve/remove data. Most websites have the privacy policy section. Often times, it’s legally required. When the project is dealing with privacy and personal data, and when it can directly affect the participants, we need to have the empathy towards the users/participants, and it’s better to be on the safe side.

For this project, we will use dummy data instead of real person data. Here are a few websites where you can create different kinds of dummy data: 

- http://dummydata.me/generate
- https://mockaroo.com
- http://www.generatedata.com

If the generator does not have the data field you need, you can manually create them as well. (We are need 30 different ones.)


## Design mockup/prototype
Based on the data you have available and the concept you have developed, **create two different design prototypes**. For the two prototypes, you may create variations on the same concept, or you may try two very different design concepts. You may first design them in Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign or you may go straight into p5js and start coding. Use whatever method that works for you. The prototypes may not have any interactivity yet, but it should show us what the final images may look like.

What you will bring next week:
- CSV file you generate
- Two different design prototypes (image, pdf, etc.)
