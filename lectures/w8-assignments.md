## Prepare the data
We have to be extremely careful about collecting other people’s data and using them. We need proper consents and other systematic measures to store/retrieve/remove data. Most websites have the privacy policy section. Often times, it’s legally required.

Although you may not be programming, you will still have to think in terms of variables and functions.
