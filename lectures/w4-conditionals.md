# Conditionals

Let me introduce a new system variable `mouseIsPressed`. This is a variable that will return `true` if the mouse is pressed and `false` if the mouse is not pressed. This type of variables are called boolean variables. It has only two states - `true` or `false`. Now, we can make part of our program run only when the condition is met.
