# Project: Parametric Design

We will create a design system that is controlled by the parameters you feed into. Instaed of focusing on individual design outcomes, we will create rules and systems that can generate many different variations. To do this, we will have to rethink about the role of a designer. How do you work with the large data you have? How do you create a more personalized/customized experience? Will you hand-craft each and every variation? 
- data must be used to "seed" design.
- Data change. Design must change, too.

You will work with data you collect or find online, and map the data to visual forms. 

Choose one of the options below for your project:
- Choose a company and create unique business cards for its 50 employees.
- Choose an event and create unique name tags for the 50 participants.
- Design unique book covers for the 50 books. 
- 

Collect data - Give each item a visual identity through a series of set questions/data.



## Process

### Step 1
- research (company/event, people, example, visuals)
- decide what data to collect (personal info, momentary info, )
- develop visual concepts. 
- how the parameters and visuals relate to the theme/identity. (figurative, abstract)

### Step 2
- collect data (google form, dummy data)
- parse data into js objects

### Step 3
- build a visual system using parameters (clear or abstract)
- map data to visual
- test (w/new data)
- adjust the rules and ranges (make it adaptable, flexible. set the boundaries).
- repeat and iterate. curate.
- scalable for the future (different dataset in the future)
- export

## Techniques
- loop
- array
- js objects
- spreadsheet to json/csv
- text parsing


Notes:
- the amount of work/data to process: only possible with computational design
- unique questions for individuals (favorite colors, etc.)
- interpreting data (type, color, form, length => all become parameters)
- combine data + random (some part)
- visualizing data (aesthetic and functional)
- should work with any new data (not just the initial 50 people)
- context: where it will be used (web? print?)
- tools: p5.js(web) + CSS, Processing(print), Sketch app (web/mobile)


## Challenges
- strong visual concept
- consistency, continuity of the visual design
- represent the company/event's identity through the visual system
- iterate through design/coding
- flexibility; adaptability for exceptional cases (ex. very long name, covering the entire range (age, etc.))
- documentation (process & result)
