# Project: Design System

- data must be used to "seed" design.
- What is your role as a designer in this? working with massive amount of data. hand-crafting each and every one?
- Data change. Design must change, too.

-----

Choose one of the options below for your project:
- Choose a company and create unique business cards for its 50 employees.
- Choose an event and create unique name tags for the 50 participants.
- Design unique book covers for the 50 books from a publisher. 
-

Give each item a visual identity through a series of set questions/data.



## Process

### Step 1
- research (company/event, people, example, visuals)
- decide what data to collect (personal info, momentary info, )
- develop concept. 
- how to visualize. how to connect to the theme/identity. (figurative, abstract)

### Step 2
- collect data (google form, dummy data)
- parse data

### Step 3
- build a visual system using parameters (clear and obvious, abstract, generate from)
- map data to visual
- test (w/new data)
- adjust the rules, range (make it adaptable, flexible). set the boundaries.
- repeat and iterate. curate. (doesn't have to be all automatic)
- scale (for 100, 200, future possibility)
- export

## Techniques
- loop
- array
- js objects
- spreadsheet to json/csv
- text parsing


Notes:
- the amount of work/data to process: only possible with computational design
- unique questions for individuals (favorite colors, etc.)
- interpreting data (type, color, form, length => all become parameters)
- combine data + random (some part)
- visualizing data (aesthetic and functional)
- should work with any new data (not just the initial 50 people)
- context: where it will be used (web? print?)
- tools: p5.js(web) + CSS, Processing(print), Sketch app (web/mobile)


Challenges:
- consistency; continuity
- strong visual concept
- represent the event's identity through each design
- design/coding iterations
- flexibility; adaptability (ex. very long name, covering the entire range (age, etc.))
- documentation (process)
- documentation (code & project for later use and collaboration and editing)
