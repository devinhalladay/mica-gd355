# Project: Parametric Design System

You will create a design system that is controlled by the parameters you define. Instaed of focusing on individual design outcomes, You will create rules and systems that can generate many different variations. To do this, You will have to rethink about the role of a designer. How do you work with the large amount of data? How do you create a more personalized/customized experience? Will you hand-craft each and every variation? Will you automate and randomize everything? Who makes the decisions for your design? How do you maintain your design system? 

You will work with data you collect yourself or find online, and map the data to visual forms. 

Choose one of the options below for your project:
- Choose a company and create unique business cards for its 30 employees.
- Choose an event and create unique name tags for the 30 participants.
- Design unique book covers for the 30 books. 
- (You may suggest other options.)

Remember that you are not making decisions for every single design variation. You are designing *a system*.

To collect the data, you will ask a series of questions (ie. google form) to get to know the participants better. The data you collect should be in a table form (ie. google spreadsheet). You will then bring into p5.js, and process them. You will interpret the data as parameters/variables to determine the visual form/identity (ex. type, color, form, length, etc.). Some part can also be generated randomly. You will start with 30 different variations, but your system should be flexible and adaptable enough to handle any new data that may be fed into later. 


## Requirements
- Your system should be functional and usable.
- Most of the work should be done algorithmically using p5js.
- You will document the entire process using writings, images, videos, etc.

## Deliverables
- A PDF file: This documents your process and result. You will do a presentation at the end.
- The data you used: CSV file
- The code: well-organized, commented and readable.
- The outcomes(images) created with your system.

## Challenges
- strong visual concept
- consistency, continuity of the visual design
- represent the company/participant's identity through the visual system
- iterate through design/coding
- flexibility; adaptability for exceptional cases (ex. very long name, covering the entire range (age, etc.))
- understand the context - where and how will it be used?
- documentation (process & result)



## Process

### Step 1
- research (company/event, people, inspirations, references, examples, codes, visuals)
- decide what data to collect (personal info, momentary info, etc.)
- develop visual concepts. 
- create mockups (PS, AI, Sketch, etc.)
- how the parameters and visuals relate to the theme/identity. (figurative, abstract)

### Step 2
- collect data (google form, dummy data)
- parse data into js objects

### Step 3
- build a visual system using parameters (clear or abstract)
- map data to visual
- test with different data. find the extremes.
- adjust the rules and ranges (make it adaptable, flexible. set the boundaries).

### Step 4
- repeat and iterate. curate.
- scalable for the future (different dataset in the future)
- export
