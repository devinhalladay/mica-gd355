# Project: Parametric Design

We will create a design system that is controlled by the parameters you feed into. Instaed of focusing on individual design outcomes, we will create rules and systems that can generate many different variations. To do this, we will have to rethink about the role of a designer. How do you work with the large data you have? Will you hand-craft each and every variation? 
- data must be used to "seed" design.
- Data change. Design must change, too.

You will work with data you collect or find online, and map the data to visual forms. 

Choose one of the options below for your project:
- Choose a company and create unique business cards for its 50 employees.
- Choose an event and create unique name tags for the 50 participants.
- Design unique book covers for the 50 books. 
- 

Collect data - Give each item a visual identity through a series of set questions/data.



## Process

### Step 1
- research (company/event, people, example, visuals)
- decide what data to collect (personal info, momentary info, )
- develop concept. 
- how to visualize. how to connect to the theme/identity. (figurative, abstract)

### Step 2
- collect data (google form, dummy data)
- parse data

### Step 3
- build a visual system using parameters (clear and obvious, abstract, generate from)
- map data to visual
- test (w/new data)
- adjust the rules, range (make it adaptable, flexible). set the boundaries.
- repeat and iterate. curate. (doesn't have to be all automatic)
- scalable for the future (different dataset in the future)
- export

## Techniques
- loop
- array
- js objects
- spreadsheet to json/csv
- text parsing


Notes:
- the amount of work/data to process: only possible with computational design
- unique questions for individuals (favorite colors, etc.)
- interpreting data (type, color, form, length => all become parameters)
- combine data + random (some part)
- visualizing data (aesthetic and functional)
- should work with any new data (not just the initial 50 people)
- context: where it will be used (web? print?)
- tools: p5.js(web) + CSS, Processing(print), Sketch app (web/mobile)


Challenges:
- strong visual concept
- consistency; continuity of the visual design
- represent the company/event's identity through the system
- design/coding iterations
- flexibility; adaptability for exceptional cases (ex. very long name, covering the entire range (age, etc.))
- documentation (process)
- documentation (code & project for later use and collaboration and editing)
