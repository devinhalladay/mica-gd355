# Interactive Clock Face Design

For the final project, create a clock (or watch) face with p5js. The goal is to create a working prototype.

You can make it as practical and functional, or as experimental and unconventional as you want, but make sure you are not just replicating an existing design, and suggest a different way of looking at time.

You should define your own goal. What are you trying to achieve with your design? (ex. I want to create interesting visual forms to keep track of time. I want to explore the subjectivity of time. I want to explore different type treatments in displaying time, etc.) Your goal should be realistic - something that you can finish by the end of the semester.

Then, do some research and come up with an interesting design concept. Collect your references and inspirations for both design and coding.

Think about ways to expand your design. Just to give your some ideas: 
- use text, image and/or shapes
- animation and interaction
- get real time data (ie. location, zip code, temperature, etc.) through APIs.
- audio and video
- what else?

Once you have your design concept, you need to make a first working prototype as quickly as possible. This is to see if it is realistic to pursue your idea, and also to identify which area you should devote your energy on.

Break down your problems into smaller parts - break them until it is something you can handle. Make more working prototypes. Test. Reflect. Iterate and improve.

Document the whole process. Save versions. Take notes. Take screenshots. Record videos. Organize your materials. Share your process with other people.

## Deliverables
1. Project files: we should be able to run the page on any machines.
2. Documentation: a multi-page PDF document, which describes your process throughout the project. (image and text. you can include video as well.)
