## Coding assignment
Using loops and transformations, create two pattern sketches:
- Create one 2-dimensional pattern using nested for loops. Below will be the structure you will need to use:
  ```js
  for (var i = 0; i <= width; i += 40) {
    for (var j = 0; j <= height; j += 40) {
      // do something cool here.
    }
  }
  ```

- Create one radial pattern using transformations such as `translate()`, `scale()` and `rotate()`.
