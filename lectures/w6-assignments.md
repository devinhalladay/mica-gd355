# Week 6 assignments

## Reading
Read [this article](https://runemadsen.com/blog/on-meta-design-and-algorithmic-design-systems/) and write a short summary (1-2 paragraphs) + your response and post it on Google Drive.

## Coding assignment
Using loops and transformations, create two pattern sketches:
- Create one 2-dimensional pattern using nested for loops. Below is an example of the structure:
  ```js
  for (var i = 0; i <= width; i += 40) {
    for (var j = 0; j <= height; j += 40) {
      // do something cool here.
    }
  }
  ```

- Create one radial pattern using transformations such as `translate()`, `scale()` and `rotate()`.
- Post both sketch codes on Google Drive.
- *Bonus points: Add animation and interactions to make the patterns dynamic. Give users control to customize them. Add user interface elements to make them more usable to non-coders.*
