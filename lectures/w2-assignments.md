# Week 2 assignments

# Responsive Poster project
- Instead of targeting a general audience, choose a specific audience group.
- Think about the context: when, where and how people will view your work.
- Research the materials. Think about how to effectively deliver the message to your audience.
- Start with making rough sketches.
- Choose 2 strongest ideas and turn them into digital mockups. (use photoshop or illustrator) You don't need to do any coding at this point.
- Each mockup should show small, wide, tall and big layout concepts. (see my layout template)
- Present 2 different polished digital mockups (each with four different layout concepts) next week.
- All files must be submitted on Google Drive Week 2 folder **before** beginning of next class. Anything submitted or changed after will be marked late.
