# Data-driven Form-making

For the final project, we will create forms through computation. The forms (and how they behave) will be driven by some form of data (CSV, JSON or plain text). Depending on how you want to use this opportunity, it may be a continuation of creating a parametric system, or you may keep it more experimental and use data to create unexpected results. Use this opportunity to further your study of programming skills. Try learning new algorithms.

The data may be your personal data or public data. It may be historic or momentary data. We have already looked at how CSV data can be used in p5js sketches. The plain text itself can also be used as data.

Not only the final outcome, but also the whole process will be important — how much progress you make each week, how much self-learning you do and how much you can find the right resources. Every week until the final, we will keep creating prototypes, gradually developing the design and the code. Be prepared to present “working” prototypes each week.

A word of caution: 

Since we only have three weeks left in the semester after the Thanksgiving break, the idea and the prototype you bring in next class should demonstrate that you will be able to realize your ideas within the given timeframe. Do a thorough research on the topic and the techniques. Choose something that is challenging and doable.

## Examples of data sources
- [Reporter app](http://www.reporter-app.com) on iOS: for collecting personal data.
- [Moves app](https://www.moves-app.com): tracking the daily steps and places.
- [Open Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov) public data
- [New York City open data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us)

*Most data will be provided in CSV format. If that’s not available, you can also try JSON format. The Coding Train has tutorials on how to use it.*

## Requirements
- Use text-based data (CSV, JSON or plain text) as a starting point
- The final outcome will be either still images or webpages. There may or may not be animation/interaction.

## Deliverables
- multiple screenshots at each stage of development
- The code (clean, organized and commented)
- The final images and/or web page
