## Prototypes
**Create a few small prototype sketches in p5js.** Once you have a design concept, think about what you will need to do next. When you have a coding problem you don't know how to solve, break the problem down into smaller problems. Tackle each smaller problem in its most basic form. Focus on one aspect at a time. For instance, if you don't know how to load a CSV file into your sketch, look for a simple example. Create a very simple fake dataset with only a few items, and try to just display them on screen. For another example, if you don't know how to create a complex shape, start with a rectangle. These prototypes may not be in the final quality, but they should *work*. Once you have working prototypes, you will have a better understanding of the techniques. From there, keep iterating and building up your project by adding more elements and refining the design. Make sure you document each stage of the development.
