# Initial sketches review

> All artists and designers in the 21st century should have experience programming their own software…If the person is unable to shape the tool they are shaped and moulded by another person’s idea of what the software is and what software can be. -- Casey Reas

We will review the assignments and also print the images out. We will display our work on the magnetic boards in the hallway.

Follow these steps:
- first, rename your sketch folders on Google Drive (no.1 - 10)
- download the entire Drive folder
- try 2-3 sketches out (group of 2), exchange feedbacks
- create images/take screenshots. 
- name your images this way. If you are Emily and you tried John’s sketch-5,
    `john-5-emily.png`
- post all the images to Google Drive
- print the images on letter-sized paper (horizontally).
