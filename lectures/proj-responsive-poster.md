# Project: Responsive Poster

Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)) We will apply the same concpet to poster design to create a poster that works on multiple screen sizes and proportions. With this project, we move away from creating a single outcome/product, and focus on working with rules to design a system that can respond to different conditions.

Create a responsive poster to promote voting on November 6th. The poster must be non-partisan. Please do not make expressions to support or attack any particular people or political parties. You can instead focus on supporting/helping people exercise their own rights in a democratic society.

The responsive poster will be designed for a web browser, but you can think about other contexts as well - the same design may be used for banners, social media, brochure, postcard, etc.





Choose an audience group you want to communicate with. 


## Deliverable
- A responsive poster that works in a browser at any size.
- The poster must be non-partisan.
- Submit a project folder that contains all the files (html, css, images, etc.).
