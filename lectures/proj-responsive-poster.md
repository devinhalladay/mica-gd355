# Project: Responsive Poster

Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)) We will apply the same concpet to poster design to create a poster that works on multiple screen sizes and proportions. With this project, we move away from creating a single outcome/product, and focus on working with rules to design a system that can respond to different conditions.
