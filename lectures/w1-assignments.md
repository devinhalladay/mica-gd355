# Week 1 assignments

- Create a slide presentation using Reveal.js library.
- Download reveal.js library and set up a project first (folders and files)
- Remove the default slides(`<section>s`) from `index.html` and replace with your own contents.
- You will introduce your hometown to us using 12 - 15 slides. The total length of your presentation should be roughly 3 minutes.
- Try out different themes, different slide formats that Reveal.js offers. (ex. title slide, list, background-image, highlighting, etc.)
- You can also add your own classes (to html) and styles (to css).
- Use [Reveal.js website](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) to learn more about the library and how to use it. Look at `demo.html` for reference.
- If you need a review on HTML/CSS, check out courses on [lynda.com](http://lynda.com), [Khan Academy](http:/khanacademy.com) or other sources.
